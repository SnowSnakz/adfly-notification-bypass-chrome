## Alright, but why?
Because I keep getting random emails from everyone and their mom asking me if I want to sell this extension to them.

I'm not going to sell the extension, because chances are they only want it because it's mildly popular.

For those who want it because of its code, now you don't have to buy it anymore! Although, I would like to say that this code is far from revolutionary, and it's probably pretty terrible because I wrote it years ago with a very basic understanding of javascript and HTML.
